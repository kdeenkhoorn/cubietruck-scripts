#
# Default it is called to be uncertain wich MAC address the chipset has.
# Therefore it is recommendable to set the MAC address manually.
# This can be done by setting the variable MAC_ADDR with a chosen value.
# If this variable is empty or not set the default 11:22:33:44:55:66 will be chosen.
# Needless to say, if more cubietrucks are used chose different adresses for them.

MAC_ADDR=43:29:B1:55:01:01

#
# The PORT value has to be set with the tty port name connected to the brcm40183 chip.
# For the cubietruck this chip is connected to uart2.
# If this port can not be found probebly you have to enable the uart2 using setup.bin
#
# For example:
#
#     [uart_para2]
#     uart_used = 1
#     uart_port = 2
#     uart_type = 4
#     uart_tx = port:PI18<3><1><default><default>
#     uart_rx = port:PI19<3><1><default><default>
#     uart_rts = port:PI16<3><1><default><default>
#     uart_cts = port:PI17<3><1><default><default>
#
#
# The correct portname can be found by using the command:
# 
#         ls /sys/devices/platform/sunxi-uart.2/tty/
#
# Usually for Cubian it is ttyS1
#

PORT=ttyS1
